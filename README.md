# AIPlayMaker

AIPlayMaker is a Flask-based web service designed to provide optimal next moves for various board games. The service currently supports games like Tic Tac Toe and Connect4, with the support for Chess and more games coming soon.

The solution is powered by intelligent algorithms and is planned to utilize Machine Learning models for more advanced game analysis in the future. AIPlayMaker offers a simple RESTful API that allows clients to send a game board in multiple formats and receive the best possible next move or moves.

## Key Features

- Optimal move calculation for various games
- Supports multiple board formats
- RESTful API
- Powered by Minimax algorithm (for Tic Tac Toe)
- Utilizes Monte Carlo Tree Search (for Connect4)

## Upcoming Features

- Addition of Chess to the list of supported games
- Introduction of machine learning models to provide more advanced or faster game analysis
